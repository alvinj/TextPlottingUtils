# ASCII/UTF-8/Text Plotting Utilities

These are a couple of ASCII/UTF-8/Text plotting utilities that I have used recently.
I don’t have any docs here yet, but see the two functions for a few comments.


## creatAsciiValueInRangeChart

The `creatAsciiValueInRangeChart` function creates output like this:

````
+-------------------------|-------------------------+
             ^
````


## createAsciiSparklineChart

The `createAsciiSparklineChart` function creates output that looks like this, and can also be colorized:

````
  ▓▓▓▓▓ ▓ ▓  ▓▓▓ ▓▓ ▓ ▓▓▓▓  ▓ ▓  ▓▓ ▓ ▓ ▓  ▓  ▓ ▓     ▓   ▓ ▓▓   ▓ ▓  ▓  ▓▓ ▓    ▓ ▓   ▓▓ ▓▓
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
▓▓     ▓ ▓ ▓▓   ▓  ▓ ▓    ▓▓ ▓ ▓▓  ▓ ▓ ▓ ▓▓ ▓▓ ▓ ▓▓▓▓▓ ▓▓▓ ▓  ▓▓▓ ▓ ▓▓ ▓▓  ▓ ▓▓▓▓ ▓ ▓▓▓  ▓  
````


## Other utilities

These utilities depend on my `FileUtils` and `MathUtils`, so I’ve included small versions of those here as well.
